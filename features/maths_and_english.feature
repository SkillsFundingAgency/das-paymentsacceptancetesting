Feature:  Maths and English

#Background information: 
#
#Providers are paid £471 per aim. this is funded from outside the total price and is flat-profiled across the planned number of months in learning for that aim. There is no N+1, there is no money held back for completion. 
#If the learner has english and maths needs above level 2 (apprenticeship requires higher) this is funded within the total price.
#It is permissible for a Level 2 apprentice to fail level 2 English & Maths, retake the learning, but complete the programme because they have already met the policy.

Scenario: DPP-597a Non DAS Learner, taking single level 2 aim, fails, retakes beyond programme end, completes to time

Given the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 15000
	
	When an ILR file is submitted with the following data:

#DPP-645 Learner taking single level 3 aim, completes to time, no funding generated
