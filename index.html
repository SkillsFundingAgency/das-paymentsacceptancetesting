              <span class="description">    For earnings, the total cost of training for an apprentice is split between:
    - 80% of the total cost split into equal monthly instalments
    - 20% of the total cost held back until completion

    For payments, where there is no lag in ILR submission, payments follow these rules:
    - Provider payment follows the month after earnings
    - This is due to the fact that activity relating to earnings is captured for funding purposes on the fourth working day of the next calendar month
    - The levy account is debited in the same month as payment is made (although at different times in the month)
    - Spend against budget is represented against the month in which funding is earned
    - Where a levy account is used for funding, payments are made against the SFA Levy budget
    - Levy funds are used until they run out, and then co-funding is used
    - The order in which learners are funded is derived from the priorities of the commitments</span>
